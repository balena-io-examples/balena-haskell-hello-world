      subject: Keep bit rot at bay.
      body: >-
        - Pinned ghcup to version 0.1.17.8 since by default it auto-updates and
        0.1.18.0 is broken on ARM:
        https://gitlab.haskell.org/haskell/ghcup-hs/-/issues/405

        - Investigated complex "fdlock: invalid argument" bug
        (https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/5589) but couldn't
        reliably eliminate it. Updating to stack 2.9.1 may help, but seems to be
        okay now with the original 2.7.5 so leaving it be.

        - Made reason for ENV commands for ghcup more explicit for future
        maintainers.

        - Split prerequisite installs from ghcup installs for better caching and
        easier maintenance.

        - Renamed ARGs for more self-documentation, and moved them closer to
        where they're used since they're applied at each RUN and therefore
        affect caching.

        - Removed redundant `--copy-bins` flag.

        - Removed stack.yaml.lock because it's not used and at the moment does
        not provide any useful locking.

        - Changed "Cabal-version" requirement to >=1.8 from >1.2 to remove
        warning about unsupported version range syntax feature, since we have no
        reason to support the very outdated <1.8.

- commits:

        Put log directory on run image instead of build image since it is
        required at runtime.

        Put executable in WORKDIR instead of src subdirectory so it can find log
        and views.

        Restore the CMD that runs the server.
